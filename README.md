Play a pig dice game with your friends.

## About the project

This project is a game where the person who rolls the dice and gets a total of 100 points wins the game.

## Game Rule

Two players take turns repeatedly rolling a single dice. If a player rolls a 1, they score nothing for their turn and it becomes the other player's turn. If any other number is rolled, the number is added to the player's current turn total, and their turn continues. If a player chooses to 'hold', they add their turn total to their final score. However, if a player rolls two 6's in a row, they score nothing for their turn, their final score becomes 0, and turn passes to the other player. The first player to reach the 100 score wins.
